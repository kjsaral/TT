Hi Juan,

First, thank you for sending this!  I have never seen a project assessment like
this and find it very cool.

Second, I think your main question is on logins.  I like your idea.  We can do
individual URLs for each person defined by the four types.

And just to a make sure the design we sent was clear - we have 4 types, but the
only thing that changes in the program for each type is the text they see (so I
think the program is the same, except for certain parts where text is entered).

Two questions:
1. If we use the URL design you propose - if someone closes their browsers,
   they input the URL and they will go back to the same place they were,
   correct?
2. We will have a time limit on some pages - e.g. 20 minutes to do work and
   then they are automatically redirected to the next page.  If someone closes
   their browser during this time, can you tell me how the program will handle
   it?

And I'd like to confirm that we would like to start this with you.  I can do a
wire transfer for payment to your account (I need your bank info to make the
transfer) - maybe half to start and half at the end?  Whatever you like best.


Thank you!
