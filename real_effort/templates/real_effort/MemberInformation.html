<div class="row">
    <p>All choices and group member identities are anonymous. The other members in your group will
    <b>never</b> be told your specific output, nor will they be told the amount that you allocated to each
    account. Likewise, you will never be told the specific output of your group members or how
    much they allocated to each account.</p>

    <h3>There are two types of participants in this experiment:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Those that participate in a computer lab at Ohio University at a designated time</li>
        <li>Those that can participate in a location of their choice (outside of the computer lab) at any
        time within a block of 24 hours.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You will always know where your group members are performing their task when you make
    your allocation decisions. In Part 2, you will either be paired in a group with two others who are
    performing the task in the computer lab or two others who are performing the task in a location
    of their choice. In part 3, you will be paired with two others in the alternate location. In other
    words, if you are paired with two others who are performing the task in the computer lab in part
    2, you will be paired with two others who are performing the task in a location of their choice in
    part 3. If on the other hand you are paired with two others who are performing the task in a
    location of their choice in part 2, you will be paired with two others who are performing the task
    in the computer lab in part 3.</p>
