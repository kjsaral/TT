    <p><b>Last Information:</b></p>
All choices are anonymous. The other members in your group will <b>never</b> be told how many tasks you completed nor the amount that you submitted to each account. Likewise, you will never be given this information for either of your group members.</p>
    <p>Each group member knows the participant composition of the group (# telecommuters, # lab participants) and all group members are performing this independently â€“ so your group members do not know each other, or you. You will be randomly matched with members of the above type in each stage (new group in stage 3). The other members of your group may not be participating today.</p>
