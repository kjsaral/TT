    <h3>Part 1:</h3>
    <p>You are about to enter into the paid portion of the experiment. You will have a total of 5 minutes
    to type as many strings as you like. A timer in the upper right hand side of your screen will show
    your time remaining. Once the five minutes are up, you will be automatically redirected to the
    instructions for the next part of the experiment. If at any time you are disconnected from this
    website, you can follow the initial link in your email which will take you back to the experiment
    (in progress â€“ the clock will continue to run, even if the browser is closed).</p>
    <p>If you prefer not to perform this task, you are free to browse the web but you will only have the
    allotted time to complete the tasks and earn money.</p>
    <p>Please press the <span class="text-info">Continue</span> button to begin.</p>
