    <p>Thank you for participating in today's experiment.</p>
        <p>
        This experiment will have three stages: 1 short (5 minutes) individual training stage that you will participate in alone and 2 longer group stages (20 minutes each) where you will participate in a group of three. In each stage you will be asked to perform work for payment and the type of work will remain the same for the duration of today's experiment. We will explain this work more on the upcoming screens. 
        </p>
        <p>At the end, there will also be a short survey that we will use to collect your contact information for payment. Because of the nature of todayâ€™s experiment, your payment will be available within one week of your participation. Detailed instructions for how you can pick up your cash payment will be emailed to you.

All payments are confidential; no other participant will be told the amount you make. </p>
       
    <p>This experiment is self paced; so when you have finished and a
        <span class="text-info">"Continue"</span> button is available, please press it.</p>
